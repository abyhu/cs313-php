  <h1>Hello World, I am Abrial Marroquin</h1>
  <p>I am a student at BYU-Idaho majoring in Software Engineering. I am taking the CS 313 Software Engineering II course this semester. I am anxious to learn new techniques.</p>
  <p>My motto for this semester is to remain positive. As graduation nears, there are changes on the horizon. The unknown, while exciting can also be scary. I need to stay focused and continue what I love - learning. After all, that is something that won't change after graduation. I will always love learning and I will always have the opportunity to learn new things.</p>
