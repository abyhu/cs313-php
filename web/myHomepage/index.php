			 	<p id="pOne"><em>Developer and Designer</em><br> I am not satisfied with something that "works", it also needs to look good. I will often continue working on a project until I am satisfied with both functionality and user interface.</p> 
				<p id="pTwo"><em>Professional Problem Solver</em><br> I believe in using my whole "tool box" to solve problems. When faced with a problem I cannot solve, I don't give up. I will leave the project but continue thinking about potential solutions until one is found.</p> 
				<p id="pThree"><em>Life-long Learner</em><br> Even when not in school, I cannot stop learning. My most recent non-school related project was using YouTube videos to build an apartment in the basement of my home.</p>
